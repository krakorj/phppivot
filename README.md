# phppivot

PHP module to process pivot tables from relation databases. The project is aiming especially the SQLite like issue where the command 'PIVOT' is missing and a SQL request workaround is needed. 

The module consists of two parts

* Data model generation
* Data presentation

The inspiration has been taken from:

* MS Excel pivot table functionality
* Article 'MySQL pivot table' at  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7674786/mysql-pivot-table
